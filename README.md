# Project Description

This project is dedicated to managing requests and approvals for various forms, coordinating lab bookings for all MEMES office facilities, and supervising crucial operational tasks. It forms an integral part of the CS 208 curriculum, under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Abhishek Srivastava.

# Project Operation

## Form Management

Efficiency and digitization are at the core of this project's approach to form requests and approvals within the MEMES Office. This project handles two type of foms, Leave Form and Budget Forms.

### Budget Forms

Below is a catalog of the budget forms efficiently managed by the system:

- **SS04 Form**
- **MM04 Form**
- **SS01 Form**
- **R1 Form**
- **E01 Form**
- **Furniture Committee Form**

### Leave Form

The website also facilitates a rudimentary Leave Form, allowing users to submit leave requests to their respective superiors. Additionally the website allows the users to accept or reject other's leave requests.

## Lab Booking System

Beyond form management, the project seamlessly facilitates lab bookings for all 23 facilities under the MEMES Office's purview. Additionally, it meticulously maintains a comprehensive record of all bookings made through the website.
